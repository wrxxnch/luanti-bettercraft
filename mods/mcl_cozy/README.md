# Mineclonia Get Comfortable
[![ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/rudzik8/mcl_cozy/shields/downloads/)](https://content.minetest.net/packages/rudzik8/mcl_cozy/)

Adds commands to /lay or /sit to Mineclonia, as well as the ability to sit on
some blocks (stairs and slabs out-of-the-box) by right-clicking them from
[VoxeLibre](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/).

Port of the good old [cozy mod](https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?t=14143)
(originally made for MTG by everamzah) to work with VL/MCLA properly and even
provide some nice new features!
