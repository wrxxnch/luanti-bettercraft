Stairs are useful to reach higher places by walking over them; jumping is not required. Placing stairs in a corner pattern will create corner stairs. Stairs placed on the ceiling or at the upper half of the side of a block will be placed upside down.=As escadas são úteis para alcançar lugares mais altos caminhando sobre elas; sem a necessidade de pular. Colocar escadas em um padrão de canto criará escadas de canto. Escadas colocadas no teto ou na metade superior da lateral de um bloco serão colocadas de cabeça para baixo.

Slabs are half as high as their full block counterparts and occupy either the lower or upper part of a block, depending on how it was placed. Slabs can be easily stepped on without needing to jump. When a slab is placed on another slab of the same type, a double slab is created.=
Upper @1=
Double slabs are full blocks which are created by placing two slabs of the same kind on each other.=
