This mod lets you put blocks on your head.

Head blocks persist between sessions.
This mod is suitable for both survival and creative.

Run the `/blockhead` command while holding a block to put it on your head.
Run the command with an empty hand or with the `-r`/`--remove` switch to take
the block off your head.

Use `-t` or `--top` to put the block on top of your head like a hat.
Use `-T` or `--translate` to apply an arbitrary offset.

Use `-b` or `--backwards` to rotate the block 180°.
Use `--left` or `--right` to rotate the block 90°.
Use `-R` or `--rotate` to rotate the block by any angle.

Use `-S` or `--scale` to change the size of the block.

If you're in creative mode or you have the `give` privilege, you can put a
specific block on your head with `/blockhead <ItemString>`.
